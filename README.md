1- Like Button: For the user to mark that he liked the joke and then the joke is changed to a new one<br>
2- Open in Browser Button: Opens the current joke in browser<br>

The code is written using MVP Design pattern to separate Design code from Logic code. After working on this project, I discovered that there are other patterns that are more recommended to be used with flutter projects such as bloc so I will be using these patterns in my future projects.<br>

I have used Firebase used in my app 2 firebase products which are Crashlytics, and FireStore<br>
