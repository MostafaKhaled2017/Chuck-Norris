The apps shows a chuck norris  joke and below it there are 3 buttons:
1- Like Button: For the user to mark that he liked the joke and then the joke is changed to a new one
2- Open in Browser Button: Opens the current joke in browser
3- Show Relevant Photos Button: Shows results for photos related to the joke content
4- Add to Favorites: Adds the jokes to Favorites page

The code is written using MVP Design pattern to separate Design code from Logic code. After working on this project, I discovered that there are other patterns that are more recommended to be used with flutter projects such as bloc so I will be using these patterns in my future projects.
