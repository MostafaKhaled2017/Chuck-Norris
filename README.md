The apps shows a chuck norris  joke and below it there are 4 buttons:<br>
1- Like Button: For the user to mark that he liked the joke and then the joke is changed to a new one<br>
2- Open in Browser Button: Opens the current joke in browser<br>
3- Show Relevant Photos Button: Shows results for photos related to the joke content<br>
4- Add to Favorites: Adds the jokes to Favorites page (Stores using Hive) <br>
<br>
The app also has a navigation menu where the user can find the option to show the favorite jokes. <br>
<br>
The code is written using MVP Design pattern to separate Design code from Logic code. After working on this project, I discovered that there are other patterns that are more recommended to be used with flutter projects such as bloc so I will be using these patterns in my future projects.<br>
<br>
I have used Firebase used in my app 2 firebase products which are Crashlytics, and FireStore<br>
<br>
I have implemented 2 points from the advanced requirements which are:<br>
1- Storing favorite jokes in Firebase<br>
2- Filtering Jokes By Category<br>
